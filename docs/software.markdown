# [Hotspots for Emerging Epidemics: Multi-Task and Transfer Learning over Mobility Networks](https://github.com/heart-analytics/COVID19-Hotspots/blob/main/evaluation/baselines.py)
- An essential building block in implementing mitigation policies (e.g., lockdown, testing, and vaccination) is the prediction of potential hotspots, defined as the locations that contribute significantly to the spatial diffusion of infections. During the initial stages of an epidemic, information related to the pathways of spatial diffusion of infection is not fully observable, making the detection of hotspots difficult. Currently, policymakers rely primarily on the observed new infections for identifying hotspots and deciding on mitigation actions, which are reactive rather than proactive. This work proposes a new data-driven framework to identify hotspots through advanced analytical methodologies, e.g., a combination of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, multi-task learning, and transfer learning. Our methodology considers mobility within and across locations, the primary driving factor for the diffusion of infection over a network of connected locations.

# [Control Of Epidemic Spreads Via Testing And Lock-Down](https://github.com/heart-analytics/COVID19-TestingAndLockDown/blob/main/Notebooks/lockdown_cdc.ipynb)
- We present a compartmental epidemic model that accounts for the impact of lock-down and different kinds of testing, motivated by the nature of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. We consider the testing of symptomatic, contact traced, and randomly chosen asymptomatic populations. Using the model, we first characterize static mobility levels and testing requirements that can dampen the spread asymptotically. We then characterize a threshold-type optimal lock-down policy that minimizes the social impact of an epidemic, modeled via a sum of infection and lockdown costs. Our results are contextualized with realistic parameter values for COVID-19.
